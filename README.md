# UFOs
## Overview
Using HTML and JavaScript, I helped Dana build a dynamic webpage that allowed users to filter UFO sightings based on multiple criteria. UFO sightings were placed withn a table, and the available filters included date, city, state, country, and shape. A screenshot from that webpage can be viewed below:

## Resources
* data.js
* JavaScript
* HTML

## Analysis
The data table and filters are rather user-friendly. You can query UFO sightings based on a variety of factors by simply typing them into the boxes on the bottom left of the screen. For instance, I wanted to see how many UFO sightings were located in Kentucky, so i typed "ky" into the "Enter State" search box. Each box has an example format for the query because the data has specific keys. The table can only be filtered by exact keys. Therefore, I typed "ky" into the box instead of "Kentucky".

## Results

### Drawbacks
One thing I can see that is missing from the webpage is the ability to clear the search. To revert to the original table, I had to refresh the webpage. 

### Further Recommendations
It would be nice if the search bars had dropdown menus with predetermined entries. For instance, you could have a dropdown menu of all the states or countries that users are capable of selecting. I think being able to filter the date by month as well as year would be helpful. Lastly, giving users the option to export their filtered table into a .csv file would be a nice addition to the webpage...if that's possible.
